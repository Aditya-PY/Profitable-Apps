# Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets

This is a Guided Project by Dataquest.io

## Introduction

This project will focus on analysing the data from apps in the app store and google play markets to deduce which app's are the most profitable.

The data sets used in this project can be viewed by clicking the following links:

[Google Play Store Apps](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps) by Lavanya Gupta

[Mobile App Store (7200 apps)](https://www.kaggle.com/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps) by Ramanathan

**Project Goal**: To analyze data to help understand what type of apps are likely to attract more users and be profitable.

In the process of analysing this data for the project I try to focus on getting more comfortable with the following python topics/concepts:

* The basics of programming in Python (arithmetical operations, variables, common data types, etc.)
* List and for loops
* Conditional statements
* Dictionaries and frequency tables
* Functions
* Jupyter Notebook
